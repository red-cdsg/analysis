# Analysis
This is a public repository. This has some implications. The name of this repository suggests that this involves analysis. For a person like me, that word could mean many things. First of all, let me make it clear that this involves exploratory data analysis, E.D.A and not something like real analysis.
<br>
## Note
I did say that this repository does not involve something like real analysis directly. However, it is not at all hard for a person like me to understand that this is not completely possible. I will be apply my knowledge of mathematical statistics to perform exploratory data analysis.
